I walk through the color jungle. I take out my flashlight canteen.
There's a wet parrot with a wide phone in his mouth right in front of me in the green trees! I gaze at his cold bottle.
A sudden sound awakes me from my daydream!
A panther jumps in front of my head! I run at his loud breath.
I remember I have a packet of posie that makes it go into a deep slumber!
I throw it away in front of the sky.
Yes he's eating it! I walk away through the dark jungle. I meet my parents at the tent.
Phew; Itâ€™s been an exciting day in the jungle.
